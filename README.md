# Quordle
Quordle game recreated using C++

🔧 Prerequisites:
A C++ compiler (e.g. g++)
A terminal that supports ANSI escape codes (VS Code terminal, Git Bash, Linux terminal, Windows Terminal)

📝 Notes
Written in pure C++, using standard libraries only.
No external dependencies or file input required.
Terminal color issues are handled with proper resets at the end of execution.
Uses hardcoded word list for simplicity — future versions can use random word selection or file input.

✨ Future Improvements (Ideas)
Add emoji-only feedback for universal compatibility
Use file-based word banks with random selection
Track previous guesses for each box
GUI version with SDL or Qt
Online multiplayer
